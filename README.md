# EDA-Movie-Set
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a movie data set
Version 1.0 completed 03 Jan 2017 
This is one of my first exploratory data analysis projects and one of the first time using Jupyter notebook.
At the end of the notebook I added a summary for my collected thoughts on what I saw in the data. 
If you would like to verify the notebook I included the original data set that I used a csv format. 
I had a lot of fun with this project and look forward to more like it even though I didnâ€™t get past 
the point of correlation and to cause and effect.
